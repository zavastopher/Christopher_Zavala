It is now the beginning of the second half of the 2023 fall semester and my graduation is on the horizon. My projects have been going well and I have been keeping my head above water. This semester is a heavy workload meant to allow for my graduation in december but that also means that I have had little to no time to update this repo and most of my projects that I am working on are not quite at the state that I can confidently push them to this repository, so in their stead this update will serve as a log of my progress so far.

- Senior design:
    - I am currently taking the senior design course at NCSU. I was assigned to a group working on a project involving CRUD, User Account Management, Web Scraping, Client-Server project implementation, and task brockering.
- Web-Development:
    - I am also taking a web-development class focusing on client-server computing. I have developed several smaller projects used to demonstrate basic web-development skills such as HTML, CSS, DOM object manipulation in JS, Node-JS, API implementation, Client side and Server side rendering, Docker deployment, Session cookie management, and much more. I am also working on a semester long group project focusing on implementing all of these skills.
- Databases:
    - I have also been learning about database management with a focus on MySQL as the core technology used during the course. I have learned a lot about Normalization, Database insertions, Table creation, and SQL Connection libraries. I am also about to start yet another project, this one focusing on designing and implementing a database
- Social-Computing and Decentralized AI:
    - This course has been focused mainly on the theory behind Social-Computing and Decentralized AI. Learning about how agents interact, how contracts can be violated w/ out technically violating them, and how to properly motivate user agents without violating concepts such as autonomy.
- Computer Music Compisition:
    - And finally we get to a course that has been great for making me consider new ways of thinking and widening my perspective. This course has taught me how to combine one of my biggest hobbies and the field I have dedicated myself to. Learning about the history of algorithmic compisition and synthesis. I am now also embarking on a journey to produce my own piece using said techniques. As of right now I am looking into simulating a simple rouguelike dungeon game in python and using the output to compose a piece using midi.

# Timeline

## 08-2023
I created this repository to host my portfolio projects in order to keep track of and demonstrate my skills as a developer. I am fully aware I should have done this earlier and excuses do not fix that issue, that being said here are some of the reasons I have for not doing so earlier in order to reassure some doubts as to why a senior in a CSC program took so long to set up a personal portfolio.

1. **Time**: during my first few years of schooling I was still going back to my hometown during the summers. During this time that I could have started developing a portfolio I worked 5 days a week at an internship and then spent my weekends working with my parents in the service industry.

2. **Awareness**: I will admit I *should* have been more aware of what the differenece between software development and computer science was, unfortunately due to a lack of resources growing up and lack of awareness I did not and that has led to my "late" start.

3. **Knowing Where To Start**: The internet is amazing in providing resources to learn how to grow as a developer and learning new technologies. What it isn't great at is guiding people who are naive. Sure, there are those who have great courses out there for guiding newbie developers but most of the time the kind of guidance I needed was the kind a mentor would have provided but I didn't know who to ask, what to ask of them, or even that I needed to ask someone to guide me in the first place.

4. **Laziness**: This one is a hard pill to swallow. No one likes to think of themselves as lazy, especially in a field where grinding out long hours on development projects is a badge of honor, but if I am being honest with my self this has set me back. Now I'm not saying that I was sitting around staring at a wall. What ended up happening was that when I finally was able to have a summer where I could have focused on working on my portfolio it was also the first summer since I was a child that I was not working 7-days a week. *-Side Note: while this might seem like an exageration I assure you it is not. The town that I grew up in was a tourist town with no secondary industry to rely on, therefore it was necessary to work as much as possible during the tourist season and use the money earned during that time to hold you over till the start of the next season, now back to the point.-* As a result I did not know how to properly relax, I overdid it and ended up wasting my time overindulging in hobbies and sleeping. This led to massive amounts of guilt during the school year and one thing led to another leading to a severe mental health decline that dramatically tanked my scholastic performance as well.

With all of these things considered I am now in a place where I can finally start taking the steps to start honing my skills. I have learned a lot at my time at NCSU but it is now up to me to demonstrate these skills, hence the creation of this repo.
