# About

MovieBase was a project for a databases class during my time at state.
This project was meant to put our knowledge of database structure and
implementation to the test. My group and I worked on proposing the 
project, designing the swimlanes for user interactions with the system, 
designing wireframes for the user interactions, and finally we implemented
the project using docker, NodeJS, MySQL, and Express.

# My Contributions To the Project

I personally created one swimlane, a wire frame, the frontend pages,
and initialized the project skeleton. This involved creating the Docker
files for each container and configuration file for the nGinx reverse
proxy. I configured the project to use a .env file so that the project
secret keys could remain local to the machine it was being run on.
